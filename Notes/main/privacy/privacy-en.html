        <p><strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Austria: </strong>In addition to the data protection
            regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Austria. This includes in

                numbers, involved persons). Log data (e.g., log files regarding logins or data retrieval or access
                times).</li>

            <li><strong>Provision of Online Offer on Rented Storage Space:</strong> For the provision of our online

                corresponding server provider (also called "web host"); <span class=""><strong>Legal Bases:</strong>

        <h2 id="m328">Plug-ins and Embedded Functions and Content</h2>
        <p>We integrate function and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their
            respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may include graphics,
            videos, or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").</p>
        <p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the users' IP
            addresses, as they could not send the content to their browsers without the IP address. The IP address is
            thus necessary for the display of these content or functions. We strive to use only such content whose
            respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may
            also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing
            purposes. Through the "pixel tags", information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website can be
            evaluated. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the users' devices and may include
            technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time, and other
            details regarding the use of our online offer, as well as be linked to such information from other sources.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Notes on Legal Bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers,
            the legal basis of the data processing is consent. Otherwise, the users' data are processed based on our
            legitimate interests (i.e., interest in efficient, economical, and recipient-friendly services). In this
            context, we also refer you to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>

        <ul class="m-elements">
            <li><strong>Google Fonts (Obtaining from Google Server):</strong> Obtaining fonts (and symbols) for the
                purpose of a technically secure, maintenance-free, and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to
                their up-to-dateness and loading times, their uniform display, and consideration of possible license
                restrictions. The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be
                made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution,
                operating system, used hardware) are transmitted, which are necessary for the provision of the fonts
                depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data may be processed on a server of
                the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offer, users' browsers send their browser HTTP
                requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google
                Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of Google Fonts and then the fonts
                specified in the CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to
                access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the
                user-agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well
                as the referring URL (i.e., the website on which the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are
                neither logged nor stored on Google servers, and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs
                details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user-agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is
                restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families that the user wants
                to load fonts for. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family
                is requested. The Google Fonts Web API must adapt the font to the specific browser type based on the
                user-agent. The user-agent is primarily logged and used for debugging and to generate aggregated usage
                statistics to measure the popularity of font families. These aggregated usage statistics are published
                on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally, the referring URL is logged so that the data can be
                used for production maintenance and to generate an aggregated report on the top integrations based on
                the number of font requests. According to its own information, Google does not use any of the
                information collected by Google Fonts to create profiles of end users or to display targeted
                advertisements;<br>

        <h2 id="m1360">Processing of Data in Employment Contexts</h2>
        <p>In the context of employment relationships, the processing of personal data aims to effectively establish,
            manage, and terminate such relationships. This data processing supports various operational and
            administrative functions necessary for the management of employee relations.</p>
        <p>This data processing covers various aspects ranging from contract initiation to termination. It includes the
            organization and management of daily working hours, management of access rights and permissions, as well as
            handling of personnel development measures and employee appraisals. The processing also serves payroll
            management and salary administration, which are critical aspects of contract execution.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the data processing takes into account the legitimate interests of the responsible employer,
            such as ensuring workplace safety or recording performance data to evaluate and optimize operational
            processes. Furthermore, the data processing includes the disclosure of employee data as part of external
            communication and publication processes where necessary for operational or legal purposes.</p>
